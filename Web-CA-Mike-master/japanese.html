						<h3> Vernal Equinox Day/Shunbun no Hi</h3><br>
						<img src ="images/Vernal Equinox Day.jpg" alt="Vernal Equinox Day">
						<p>Vernal Equinox Day 春分の日 Shunbun no Hi is a public holiday in Japan that occurs on the date of the Northward equinox in Japan Standard Time the vernal equinox can occur on different dates in different time-zones,
						usually March 20 or 21. The date of the holiday is not officially declared until February of the previous year, due to the need for recent astronomical measurements.
						Vernal Equinox Day became a public holiday in 1948. Prior to that it was the date of Shunki kōreisai 春季皇霊祭, an event relating to Shintoism.
						Like other Japanese holidays, this holiday was repackaged as a non-religious holiday for the sake of separation of religion and state in Japan's postwar constitution.
						Pre-1945 State Shinto or Kokka Shinto is defined as the Shinto activities surrounding the support of government ideals that the government would have control over. 
						These include day to day worship at public shrines and their messages, traditional ceremony Kokutai Cult and rites performed among the Imperial households,
						and shrines specifically symbolizing the death of fallen soldiers in battle. On December 15, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur introduced what would later be called the Shinto Directive. 
						The order was a directive titled the Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Perpetuation, Control, and Dissemination of State Shinto.
						This however was difficult due to the Emperor being at the center of many Shinto rituals. The purpose of the mandate was to separate State Shinto and Shrine Shinto which would be separating all government ties to the control of religious activities while supporting public shrines available to everyone and would be supported privately.
						This would later on be a part of the new Japanese constitution ratified in 1948.</p>

						<h3> Culture Day/Bunka no Hi</h3><br>
						<img src ="images/Culture Day.jpg" alt="Culture Day">
						<p>Culture Day 文化の日 Bunka no Hi? is a national holiday held annually in Japan on November 3 for the purpose of promoting culture, the arts, and academic endeavor.
						Festivities typically include art exhibitions, parades, and award ceremonies for distinguished artists and scholars.Culture Day was first held in 1948, to commemorate the announcement of the post-war Japanese constitution on November 3,						1946.
						November 3 was first celebrated as a national holiday in 1868, when it was called Tenchō-setsu 天長節, a holiday held in honor of the birthday of the reigning Emperor — at that time, Emperor Meiji.
						Following Meiji's death in 1912, November 3 ceased to be a holiday until 1927, when his birthday was given its own specific holiday, known as Meiji-setsu 明治節.
						As Meiji-setsu was discontinued with the announcement of Culture Day in 1948, some see Culture Day as a continuation of this tradition as well—a mere renaming of Meiji-setsu—although they are ostensibly unrelated.</p>

						<h3> Coming of Age Day/Seijin no Hi</h3><br>
						<img src ="images/Coming of Age Day.jpg" alt="Coming of Age Day">
						<p>Coming of Age Day 成人の日 Seijin no Hi? is a Japanese holiday held annually on the second Monday of January. It is held in order to congratulate and encourage all those who have reached the age of majority 20 years old 二十歳 hatachi over the past year,
						and to help them realize that they have become adults. Festivities include coming of age ceremonies 成人式 seijin-shiki held at local and prefectural offices,
						as well as after-parties amongst family and friends.Coming of age ceremonies have been celebrated in Japan since at least 714 AD, when a young prince donned new robes and a hairstyle to mark his passage into adulthood.
						The holiday was first established in 1948, to be held every year on January 15. In 2000, as a result of the Happy Monday System, Coming of Age Day was changed to the second Monday in January.
						Until recently, all young adults attending the coming of age ceremony were exactly 20, having held their 20th birthday after the previous year's Coming of Age Day but before the present Coming of Age Day.</p>
