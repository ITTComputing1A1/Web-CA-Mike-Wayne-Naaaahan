			Christianity is an Abrahamic religion. People who believe in Christianity are called Christians (Greek Χριστιανός). It is a monotheistic religion, meaning it has only one God. It is the largest religion in the world and is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

			Jesus Christ is the central figure of Christianity.<br>
			Jesus was a carpenter and preacher in ancient Judea. He was executed by being nailed to a cross (or crucified), under Pontius Pilate, the local Roman governor at the time. His life and followers are written about in the New Testament, part of the Bible. Christians see the Bible, both the Old Testament and New Testament as sacred. The Gospels or "The Good News" are the first four books of New Testament that are about Jesus' life, death and rising from the dead.
			<br>
			Most Christians believe in the Trinity, which means that there are three different persons of the Godhead. The three persons of the Godhead are the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God created the world. Jesus is the name of God the Son. Christians believe Him to be the Son of God. They believe that He was the human son of the Virgin Mary and the divine Son of God. They believe He suffered and died to free humans from their sin, and was later raised from the dead. He then went up into heaven. Christians believe that Jesus will come back to Earth to judge all mankind, both alive and dead, giving everlasting life to those who believe in him. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of God on the Earth that spoke through prophets.
			<br>
			Christians believe that the prophets foretold in Old Testament of Jesus as the Savior. Christians think of Jesus Christ as a teacher, a role model and someone who revealed who the Christian God was.
			<br>
			Just like Judaism and Islam, Christianity is an Abrahamic religion. Christianity started out as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean. It quickly grew in number of believers and influence over a few decades, and by the 4th Century it had become the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. The Kingdom of Aksum became the first empire to adopt Christianity. During the Middle Ages, the rest of Europe mostly was Christianized. At that time, Christians were mostly a religious minority in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of India. Following the Age of Discovery, through missionary work and colonization, Christianity spread to Africa, the Americas and the rest of the world
