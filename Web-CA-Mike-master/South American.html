						<h3> Mardi Gra</h3><br>
						<img src ="images/mardi gra.jpg" alt="mardi gra">
						<p>Mardi Gras , also called Shrove Tuesday, or Fat Tuesday,in English, refers to events of the Carnival celebrations,
						beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany Three Kings Day and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday. <br><br>
						Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, reflecting the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season.
						Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent.<br><br>
						In countries such as England, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word shrive, meaning confess.</p>

						<h3> Dios De Muertos</h3><br>

						<p>Day of the Dead Spanish: Día de Muertos is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico, in particular the Central and South regions, and by people of Mexican ancestry living in other places,
						especially the United States. It is acknowledged internationally in many other cultures. The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey.
						In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.<br><br>
						The holiday is	sometimes called Día de los Muertos in Anglophone countries, a back-translation of its original name, Día de Muertos. 
						It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer.
						Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1 and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christian triduum of Allhallowtide All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. 
						Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed,
						and visiting graves with these as gifts. Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves.<br><br>
						Scholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl.
						The holiday has spread throughout the world, being absorbed within other deep traditions for honoring the dead. It has become a national symbol and as such is taught in the nation's schools.
						Many families celebrate a traditional All Saints' Day associated with the Catholic Church.<br><br>
						Originally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions.
						The people and the church rejected it as a day related to syncretizing pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional All Saints' Day in the same way as other Christians in the world.
						There was limited Mesoamerican influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated.<br><br>
						In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, Día de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.</p>
